            <p class="story">
                Obstacles are not the end; they are opportunities to grow stronger. Every setback builds resilience, and
                every challenge
                brings valuable lesson. True strength lies in the courage to rise after every fall, knowing that
                persistence leads to
                progress. With determination as our guide, we turn obstacles into opportunities and dreams into reality.
                Defeat may test
                us, but it can never define us—because within us lies the power to overcome, grow, and thrive.

                        Life’s challenges may knock us down, but they can’t keep us there. Each setback is an
                        opportunity to rise, learn, and

                        stones. No matter how tough
                        the journey, we must never surrender. Success comes through perseverance.

                        to those who refuse to give up. No defeat is final unless we allow it to be.

                <p class="story">
                    Growth is not about avoiding defeat but about rising stronger each time we fall. Inspired by Maya
                    Angelou’s powerful
                    words, I’ve learnt to see every challenge as an opportunity to grow. Whether it’s confronting fears,
                    embracing change,
                    or pushing beyond my comfort zone, progress comes from consistent effort and unwavering
                    determination. True growth is a
                    daily choice—to turn setbacks into stepping stones and adversity into strength. No defeat can define
                    us unless we allow
                    it. Each challenge is a chance to rise stronger, proving that our potential knows no limits.
